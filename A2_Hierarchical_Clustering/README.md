# Hierarchical Clustering
## Similarity Matrix & Dendogram
We compute the similarity matrix with the euclidean metric. Then we build the dendogram with complete linkage because permite the outliers.
When the dendogram is completed, we need to cut it for build differents clusters. We choose cut in level 11 to obtain 4 different clusters.
